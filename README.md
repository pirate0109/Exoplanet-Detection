## Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning


The kepler mission was lauched to figure out earthlike planets revolving along stars. There have been more than 1000 confirmed stars with exoplanets thanks to this mission and more than 3000 stars with potential planets around it. The methodology used is Transit Photometry Method where a distant planet is detected by measuring the change in flux  of a star as it passes between a planet and the earth. Thus if the planet is present around the star, there would be miniscule reduction in the flux intensity of star during transit. 

### Dataset

The dataset was made available as a part of Annual Inter-IIT competition held in IIT Madras. This dataset contains flux of over 5000 stars in a time series form. Its a binary classification problem with label 1 represent that the star no confirmed exoplanet and 2 represented that the star has atleast one exoplanet.
