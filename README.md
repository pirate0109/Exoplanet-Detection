## Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning


The project is based on detecting exoplanets using the flux time series data. The methodology used is Transit Photometry Method where a distant planet is detected by measuring the change in flux  of a star as it passes between a planet and the earth.
The detailed explaination with Graphics is mentioned in attached PPT.
